## My Thoughts
1) OAUTH 1.0 2.0 my own 1.0..my first experience w/ oauth, so why re-invent the wheel. I used postman
2) env variables (i protected on production + dev)
3) frontend/react/heroku
4) cite built with gems; postman
5) why reinvent the wheel?
6) time was wasted w/ flickr github documentation + twitter docs (broken links + only allowed oauth + its api service would break + settled on twitter gem)
7) my commit history may have api key (i never pushed it though)
